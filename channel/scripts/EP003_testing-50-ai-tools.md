**[Slate] Step two why [Done]**
"Generic metrics don't tell you what to improve. Custom analytics show you exactly what's working."

**[Slate] Step three example [Done]**
"Here's my analytics dashboard. It shows marker performance, segment retention, and workflow efficiency."

### Phase 9: The Losers (13:30-15:00)

**[Slate] Step two warning [Done]**
"Avoid tools that claim to do everything automatically. They usually do nothing well."

**[Slate] Step three recommendation [Done]**
"Stick with specialized tools. One tool for transcription, one for editing, one for thumbnails. Don't try to do it all with one tool."

**[Slate] Apply quote [Done]**

### Phase 10: Recap & CTA (15:00-16:00)
**[Slate] Scene ten recap [Done]**

**[Slate] Step two next steps [Done]**
"In the next video, I'll show you how to set up each of these tools and integrate them into your workflow."
