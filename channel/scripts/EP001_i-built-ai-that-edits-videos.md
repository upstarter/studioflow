**Alternative Hooks (Record 3-5):**
- "What if AI could edit your videos while you sleep? I made it happen."
- "I automated my entire video production workflow. Here's how it works."
- "99% of creators waste hours editing. I built a system that does it automatically."
- "This AI edits my videos in minutes, not hours. Here's the code."

**Visual**: Close-up of you, high energy, pointing at screen/code
**Audio**: Clear, confident, energetic delivery

**Target Retention: 80%+**

**[Slate] Scene two intro [Done]**
"Hey everyone, welcome to the channel. I'm [Your Name], and I build automation systems for video production."

**[Slate] Step one branding [Done]**
"If you're new here, make sure to subscribe and hit that notification bell. I post new videos about AI automation and video production every week."

**[Slate] Step two preview [Done]**
"In this video, I'll show you the complete system I built, how it works in real-time, and how you can build your own. Let's get started."

**[Slate] Apply hook [Done]**

**Visual**: Medium shot, channel branding visible, transition to screen
**Audio**: Warm, welcoming, clear value proposition

---

### Phase 3: The Problem (0:45-2:00)
**Target Retention: 75%+**

**[Slate] Scene three problem [Done]**
"Let me start with the problem. Editing videos takes forever. I was spending 10+ hours per video just on the basics."

**[Slate] Step one pain points [Done]**
"Think about it: transcription takes hours. Creating rough cuts is tedious. Color grading is repetitive. Exporting to multiple formats is a nightmare. And I was doing this for every single video."

**[Slate] Step two solution tease [Done]**
"So I thought, what if I could automate all of this? What if AI could handle the repetitive parts while I focus on the creative? That's when I started building StudioFlow."

**[Slate] Broll screen [Done]**
[Screen recording: Show StudioFlow interface, code, or system overview]

**Visual**: You talking, then B-roll of editing timeline, then screen recording
**Audio**: Relatable problem, building to solution
**Pattern Interrupt**: Switch to screen recording at 1:30

---

### Phase 4: The System Overview (2:00-4:00)
**Target Retention: 70%+**

**[Slate] Scene four system [Done]**
"Here's how StudioFlow works. It's a complete automation pipeline that handles everything from import to export."

**[Slate] Step one transcription [Done]**
"First, AI transcribes your footage using Whisper. But here's the key: it also detects audio markers. When you say 'slate scene one done' during recording, the system knows exactly where to cut."

**[Slate] Broll screen [Done]**
[Screen recording: Show transcription in action, marker detection]

**[Slate] Step two rough cut [Done]**
"Then, it automatically creates a rough cut based on those markers. The AI analyzes your content, selects the best takes, and creates a timeline ready for editing."

**[Slate] Effect zoom [Done]**
[Zoom into timeline showing auto-segmentation, markers highlighted]

**[Slate] Step three automation [Done]**
"Finally, it exports everything to DaVinci Resolve with all your markers, segments, and metadata already organized. You just polish and publish."

**[Slate] Apply best [Done]**

**Visual**: Mix of you talking and screen recordings
**Audio**: Clear explanation, building excitement
**Pattern Interrupts**: 
- Screen recording at 2:30
- Zoom effect at 3:30
- Back to you at 3:45

### Phase 5: Deep Dive - Transcription (4:00-5:30)
**Target Retention: 65%+**

**[Slate] Scene five transcription [Done]**
"Let me show you the transcription system in detail."

**[Slate] Step one how it works [Done]**
"When you record with audio markers, the system listens for specific phrases. 'Slate' starts a marker, 'done' ends it. Everything in between is your content."

**[Slate] Broll screen [Done]**
[Screen recording: Show marker detection in real-time, transcription appearing]

**[Slate] Step two accuracy [Done]**
"The AI is incredibly accurate. It handles different accents, background noise, and even technical terms. And it's fast - a 10-minute video transcribes in about 2 minutes."

**[Slate] Effect zoom [Done]**
[Zoom into transcription showing markers, timestamps, accuracy]

**[Slate] Step three integration [Done]**
"Best part? The transcription automatically creates segments in your timeline. No manual cutting required."

**[Slate] Apply quote [Done]**

**Visual**: Primarily screen recording with your voiceover
**Audio**: Technical but accessible explanation
**Pattern Interrupt**: Return to you at 5:15

### Phase 6: Deep Dive - Rough Cut Generation (5:30-7:00)
**Target Retention: 60%+**

**[Slate] Scene six rough cut [Done]**
"Now for the rough cut generation. This is where it gets really interesting."

**[Slate] Step one algorithm [Done]**
"The system analyzes your markers and automatically creates segments. It knows that 'scene one take one' and 'scene one take two' are different takes of the same scene."

**[Slate] Broll screen [Done]**
[Screen recording: Show rough cut generation, timeline being created]

**[Slate] Step two selection [Done]**
"You can mark takes as 'best' during recording, and the system prioritizes those. Or you can review and select manually - the AI just gives you the options."

**[Slate] Effect zoom [Done]**
[Zoom into timeline showing segment organization, takes grouped]

**[Slate] Step three export [Done]**
"Once you're happy with the rough cut, one click exports everything to Resolve. All your segments, markers, and metadata are preserved."

**[Slate] Apply best [Done]**

**Visual**: Screen recording with your voiceover
**Audio**: Explaining the "magic" behind automation
**Pattern Interrupt**: Return to you at 6:45

### Phase 7: Real Demo (7:00-8:30)
**Target Retention: 65%+** (Demo increases retention)

**[Slate] Scene seven demo [Done]**
"Let me show you a real example. I recorded this video earlier today."

**[Slate] Step one before [Done]**
[Show raw footage] "This is what I recorded - just raw footage with audio markers."

**[Slate] Step two process [Done]**
[Screen recording] "Now watch what happens when I run it through StudioFlow."

[Show system processing: transcription, marker detection, rough cut generation - speed up if needed]

**[Slate] Broll screen [Done]**
[Screen recording continues: Show timeline being created automatically]

**Target Retention: 60%+**

**[Slate] Scene eight impact [Done]**
"This changed everything for me."

**[Slate] Step one time saved [Done]**
"I went from spending 10 hours per video to just 30 minutes. That's a 95% time reduction. I can now create 10 videos in the time it used to take for 1."

**[Slate] Step two quality [Done]**
"But here's the thing - the quality is actually better. The AI doesn't miss markers. It doesn't get tired. It's consistent every single time."

**[Slate] Step three scale [Done]**
"This means I can scale. I can create more content without burning out. I can focus on the creative parts - the actual content - instead of the repetitive editing tasks."

**[Slate] Apply best [Done]**
