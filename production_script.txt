=== PHASE 3: MAIN CONTENT ===

[Slate] Scene three main [Done]
Let's start with the basics. Python lists are ordered collections of items.

[Slate] Step one explanation [Done]
Python lists are ordered, which means items have a specific position. They're also mutable, so you can change them after creation.

[Slate] Step two example [Done]
Here's a simple example. We can create a list like this: my_list equals open bracket one, two, three close bracket.

[Slate] Broll screen [Done]
As you can see on screen, when we print this list, we get the exact items in order.

[Slate] Step three practice [Done]
Now let's practice together. Try creating a list with your favorite programming languages.

Now that we understand the basics, let's dive deeper into advanced operations.

[Slate] Scene four advanced [Done]
Let's explore some advanced list operations that will make your code more powerful.

[Slate] Step one concepts [Done]
Advanced list operations include list comprehensions, slicing with steps, and nested lists.

[Slate] Step two demonstration [Done]
Watch how this works. We can use list comprehensions to create lists in a single line.

[Slate] Scene five recap [Done]
Let's recap what we learned today about Python lists.

[Slate] Step one summary [Done]
Python lists are ordered, mutable collections. We can create them, modify them, and use them in powerful ways.

[Slate] Step two next steps [Done]
In the next video, we'll explore dictionaries and how they compare to lists.

# Recording Tips:
# 1. Speak clearly and pause briefly after each "slate" and "done"
# 2. Provide at least 5-10 seconds of content between markers
# 3. Use the exact marker commands as specified
# 4. Record in a quiet environment for best transcription
# 5. For the long pause, actually pause for 10 seconds (don't skip it)
# 6. This is a long recording - take breaks if needed, but maintain continuity
# 7. The rapid markers section should be done quickly (3 marks in ~4 seconds)
