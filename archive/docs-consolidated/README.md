3. `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Developer guide
4. `docs/AI_FEATURES.md` - AI capabilities
5. `docs/ROADMAP.md` - Future plans and roadmap

## Files in This Archive

These files were moved here because their content was consolidated into the new comprehensive documents. They are kept for reference but should not be used as the source of truth.

See `docs/CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md` for details on what was consolidated where.

## Note

If you need to reference old documentation, check the consolidated documents first. These archived files are kept for historical reference only.
