1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
In 2024, we saw a significant increase in climate change awareness.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,919
The data shows a 50% increase in public concern.

3
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:15,640
The problem we face is serious.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,240
We need immediate action to address this crisis.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,679
Scientists agree that time is running out.

6
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,400
The solution is clear.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,839
We must reduce emissions by 50% by 2030.

8
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:31,839
This requires cooperation from governments, businesses and individuals.

9
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,960
I remember when we first noticed the changes.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,640
It was 2020 when the wildfires became more frequent and intense.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
What can we do?

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,039
We can start by making small changes in our daily lives.

13
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,320
Every action counts.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,120
In conclusion, we must work together to solve this challenge.

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,120
The future depends on our actions today.
